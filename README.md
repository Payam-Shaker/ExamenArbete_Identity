# ExamenArbete_Identity
This project is an investigation of ASP.NET Microsoft Identity and IdentityServer4 to gain deeper knowledge about user authentication and authorization. 
The PDF document (in Swedish) https://github.com/Payam-Shaker/ExamenArbete_Identity/blob/master/PayamShaker_Examenarbete.pdf presents my investigation on the topic
which was defended in the framework of my final project (Examenarbete) at Handelsakademin spring semester 2022.
